\begin{align}

The total revenue can be calculated as           
<br />
\begin{align}
r_\text{arb} & = \sum_t \lambda(t)\big(q_d(t) - q_c(t) + \delta_{ru}(t) q_{ru}(t) - \delta_{rd}(t) q_{rd}(t)\big) \\
r_\text{reg} & = \sum_t \lambda_{ru}(t) q_{ru}(t) + \lambda_{rd}(t)q_{rd}(t) \\
r & = r_\text{arb} + r_\text{reg}
\end{align}

The data required to run this analysis in ERCOT are the day ahead LMP, reg up price, and the reg down price.
<br />
<br />
NOTE: If the energy storage device is not participating in frequency regulation, \( q_{ru}(t) \) and \( q_{rd}(t) \) are equal to zero for all \( t \).
